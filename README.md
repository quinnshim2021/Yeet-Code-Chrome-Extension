# Yeet Code

Google Chrome Extension which shows which LeetCode problems are associated with companies. All data used for this extension is public data and is simply made more convenient.

To Use:

1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Select Load Unpacked and open folder with this code (or drag and drop)
2a. Must be in developer mode to use this extension (I did not want to publish it to the Chrome Web Store)
3. Go to leetcode.com/problemset/all (or any variation of leetcode.com/problemset)
4. Press the Yeet Code icon and search for the problems highlighted in yellow. The problem numbers will have the companies associated with the problem next to it.
4a. If you change pages, search problems, or filter problems, you must turn the extension off then on again (click the icon twice)


Data used for this extension can be found here: https://github.com/rrevanth/leetcode-by-company http://www.learn4master.com/interview-questions/leetcode/leetcode-problems-classified-by-company

Future Improvements I Hope to Make:

1. Make this extension work on specific problem's pages
2. Find a more reliable (and updated) list of companies and their problems
3. Allow the user to filter to show only problems associated with companies
